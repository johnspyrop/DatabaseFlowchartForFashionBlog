# Database flowchart for a fashion blog

In this mid-term project i was tasked to create a database flowchart for a simple fashion blog.


## Appendix

A fashion bloger has tasked me to create a database for them, which will have to include users, roles, articles, comments, categories and sub categories. Additionaly, i have to make known the the relationships between the entities, their primary keys and last, but not least, their multitude ratio.
